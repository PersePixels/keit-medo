Very much a WIP right now

I'm just tryna see if I can get some proximity into overhead text chat 

But it does now have distinct colors to differentiate between "sign language" , "implied voice" , and "do actions" (/s, /t, and /d respectively)

Feel free to use and, hopefully fix/ confirm if it all works!
